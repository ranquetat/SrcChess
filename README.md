# SrcChess
Introduction
SrcChess is a chess program built in C#. Although it is not on par with commercial chess programs, SrcChess is beating me without any problem and therefore can be a 
serious opponent for casual players. The program supports a reasonable number of functions. Its biggest weaknesses are probably the lack of a good board evaluation function and of an end game database. One of its strengths is that it takes advantage of multiple processors when available. The program also includes a PGN filter that lets you import games in PGN format and build your own openings book.

I decided to make my program available so programmers can understand how a chess program works. I also hope some people will improve it.
